This directory contains two main GNN training workloads - GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Networks (GAT). Both these workloads use optimizations implemented in this extension for the MLP portion of the workloads. We have implemented optimizations for both FP32 and BF16. The two workload implementations are compatible with DGL version 0.9.

Pre-requisites: 
===============

DGL version 0.8+ 
gcc version 10.x or later
